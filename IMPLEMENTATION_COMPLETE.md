  - Multi-tier backup system (session, periodic, emergency, event-based)
  - Automatic data compression and storage optimization
  - Recovery mechanisms with session state restoration
  - Storage health monitoring and cleanup

### Phase 4: Data Export & Visualization ‚úÖ
**Components Implemented:**
- **ExportManager** (`app/scripts/experiment/exportManager.js`)
  - Multi-format export: JSON, CSV, XLSX, SPSS, R, Python
  - Statistical analysis and reporting
  - Data anonymization with privacy controls
  - Research script generation for popular analysis tools
